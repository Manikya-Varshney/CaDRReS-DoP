1. Import Libraries
2. Load model weights
3. Load the cell lines observation data in a dataframe
4. Group the expression data by their mean responses
5. Get the essential gene list for analysis with respect to the cell lines of interest
6. Normalize the expression data
7. Calculate the kernel feature from the normalized expression data, and the essential gene list
8. Now that we have the kernel, make the predictions from the model and kernel to get the relative response of new genes.
9. This response can be used to predict which drug composition is suitable for cancer control in a cell line
